# CancerDrugResponse


•	Predicted cancer drug sensitivity using gene expression data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and employing a deep-learning based architecture.

•	Corrected training loop in the model architecture paper published in Nature Communication- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33291-z

•	Achieved 63% correlation between predicted and observed drug sensitivity using solely gene expression data, 37% higher than the reported model.

See findings in the **final_report.pdf** in this repo.
